                    Hi, I'm Patrick McDermott. I'm a full-stack web developer,
                    specializing in mostly JavaScript technologies, but I also
                    work in PHP, C#, and a few other languages. My passion for
                    programming began at an early age when I built my first web
                    page in Microsoft Word. Over 15 years later, my passion for
                    development has only grown! I build web applications and
                    solutions for a wide range of purposes, including small
                    businesses, startups, and a public school district. Check
                    out my <a href='/portfolio'>portfolio</a> to see some of the
                    projects I have worked on!
                </p>
                <p class='mb-8 leading-loose'>
                    Though I have always had a passion for code, I took a
                    different career path early on in life. I pursued my other
                    passion of cooking and spent 10 years working in various
                    capacities for various restaurants, from cafeterias to
                    fine-dining restaurants. I have even assisted with opening a
                    couple of restaurant concepts. Working my way from the dish
                    pit to Sous Chef, I learned many valuable skills and gained
                    a lot of experience in teamwork, people and time management,
                    and communication. I also learned valuable skills in
                    designing effective processes and procedures, and I
                    fine-tuned my attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p class='mb-8 leading-loose'>
                    Moving from the kitchen into a technology role was a natural
                    transition for me, as a lot of the soft skills of running a
                    kitchen and the creativity and eye for detail of designing
                    dishes and building recipes transferred over into building
                    creative, effective, and functional websites and web
                    applications. The problem-solving and analytical skills that
                    I learned as a chef have allowed me to face nearly any
                    programming challenge methodically and come up with an
                    effective and performant solution for the problem.
                </p>
                <p class='mb-8 leading-loose'>
                    Aside from programming, I also enjoy writing and sharing my
                    knowledge with others. Check out my <a href='/blog'>blog</a>
                    to read some of my latest posts on technology, programming, and
                    life as a whole. On this blog, I try to share stories about my
                    struggles and successes as a programmer, and some tips, tricks,
                    and tools that I have learned or came across throughout my development
                    journey.
