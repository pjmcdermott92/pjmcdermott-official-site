                Hi, I'm Patrick McDermott. I'm a full-stack web developer, specializing in mostly JavaScript technologies, but I also work
                in PHP, C#, and a few other languages. My passion for programming began at an early age when I built my first web page in
                Microsoft Word. Over 15 years later, my passion for development has only grown! I build web applications and solutions for a
                wide range of purposes, including small businesses, startups, and a public school district. Check out my <Link

            </p>
            <p class='mb-8 leading-loose'>
                Though I have always had a passion for code, I took a different career path early on in life. I pursued my other passion of
                cooking and spent 10 years working in various capacities for various restaurants, from cafeterias to fine-dining
                restaurants. I have even assisted with opening a couple of restaurant concepts. Working my way from the dish pit to Sous
                Chef, I learned many valuable skills and gained a lot of experience in teamwork, people and time management, and
                communication. I also learned valuable skills in designing effective processes and procedures, and I fine-tuned my attention
                to detail.
            </p>
            <p class='mb-8 leading-loose'>
                Moving from the kitchen into a technology role was a natural transition for me, as a lot of the soft skills of running a
                kitchen and the creativity and eye for detail of designing dishes and building recipes transferred over into building
                creative, effective, and functional websites and web applications. The problem-solving and analytical skills that I learned
                as a chef have allowed me to face nearly any programming challenge methodically and come up with an effective and performant
                solution for the problem.
            </p>
            <p class='mb-8 leading-loose'>
                Aside from programming, I also enjoy writing and sharing my knowledge with others. Check out my <Link href='/blog'>

                to read some of my latest posts on technology, programming, and life as a whole. On this blog, I try to share stories about my
                struggles and successes as a programmer, and some tips, tricks, and tools that I have learned or came across throughout my development
                journey.
